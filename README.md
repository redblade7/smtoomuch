YKYWTMSMW Fortunes for Linux v6.0

Created by redblade7

v6.0 released on September 10, 2017 (Ami Mizuno's Birthday)
v5.x series released and updated during May 2017

These files for the Linux fortune program provide over 6500 "You Know You Watch Too Much Sailor Moon When..." jokes created between c. 1995 and 2017. 

The fortunes are derived from the TXT version of the YKYWTMSMW Compilation book, version 6, originally by Anton Ptitsin and updated by redblade7 in 2017.

Included in the "book/v5" subdirectory is the complete book, version 5 (the last from Anton-P, 2007) in DOC, PDF, and plain text.

Included in the "book/v6" subdirectory is the complete book, version 6 (the first by redblade7, 2017) in ODT, PDF, and plain text.

Included in the "book/others" subdirectory are additional books and sources used in the making of version 6.

Enjoy! -redblade7

INSTRUCTIONS:

To install, type:

"make && sudo make install"

Then, type:

"fortune smtoomuch"

to try it out.

NOTES:

(1) All grammar and spelling errors have been left intact.

(2) Some of these jokes fall under subheadings with variations of the YKYWTMSMW formula. They have been represented in fortune as follows: 

"5798.	(When You Know Your Obsessed With Sailor Saturn...) You stay in your house all day and your skin turns pale."

(3) Many of these jokes are in reference to jokes preceding or following it. This is why you may get a fortune along the lines of:

"5146.	You've actually read all of the above."

(4) Sometimes jokes have included attributions, which may not only be applicable to the joke but for previous ones. For example:

"2880.	In objecting to dissection in biology, you suggest a unit in space botany instead. All of the above are thanks to Bunny & Zelda! Thanks guys!"

When you receive #2880 as a fortune, you will not know about the preceding jokes unless you look them up.

(5) In the fortune files, special and Unicode characters were replaced for compatibility with non-Unicode terminals. This also required me to cut off the name of the authors of #4189-#4192 and #6153. (You can see their names in the book files.)

(6) There are over 6500 fortunes in these files which, depending on the amount of fortunes you have installed, might make the likelihood of receiving a YKYWTMSMW fortune higher than you want. If you want to change this behavior, see the fortune man page about the "-e" option.

(7) Slackware Linux users: Slackware will not automatically choose fortunes from these files unless you add "smtoomuch" to the end of the fortune command in /etc/profile.d/bsd-games-login-fortune.sh. You may also want to use "fortune -e" (see note #8). You can also replace the whole line with "fortune all" or, if you don't mind seeing offensive fortunes, "fortune -a".

(8) The fortunes are not currently split into offensive and non-offensive, but will be in a future release of v6.x.
