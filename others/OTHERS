B: Written before the Viz era (May 18, 2014 and earlier)
G: From a list of German language YKYWTMSMW jokes found at: http://animexx.onlinewelten.com/datenbank-zuviel.phtml?them_id=1
H: The G series, translated by members of sailormoonforum.com
R: Written by redblade7, who put together the Linux fortune files (May 11, 2017-present).
V: Written during Viz era (May 19, 2014-present)
