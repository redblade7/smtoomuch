	* As I am not like the owners of The Other SMF, there won't be any edits to existing material (other than documentation) which reference, credit, or promote The Other SMF.
	* So long as I'm allowed to, both SMF and The Other SMF will be monitored for future YKYWTMSMWs, and credit to each site and the users on it will be given as appropriate.

	* Corrected Slackware instructions with regard to viewing offensive smtoomuch fortunes at login.
	* Updates to the source code and/or books prior to official releases will be counted as "-preview(number)" for each calendar date the material has been updated. These revisions to the source are not to be considered actual "versions" - the latest release is still v6.1, the preview number is simply for convenience and testing before the final release, which in this case will be v6.11.

* v6.0 (2017-09-10, Ami Mizuno's Birthday)
	* Version 6 of the book (together with v6.0 of the fortunes) released!
	* Version 6 contains 6596 YKYWTMSMWs (551 YKYWTMSMWs larger than v5)

	* Added additional fortunes (see "others" directory)
	* Fixed possible errors in make uninstall and make clean
	* Updated Slackware note in README with information on showing all non-offensive fortunes.
	* NOTE: With Maraviollantes' permission I have taken over maintaining the book too. This means that the YKYWTMSMW Linux fortunes not found in the book will be integrated into the book and given normal numbering both in the book and in the fortunes. This version (v5.3) will be the last release based on version 5 of the book, with upcoming version 6 of the Linux fortunes to be released along with version 6 of the book. The German YKYWTMSMWs will not be in version 6 of the book.
