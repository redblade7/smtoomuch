	* NOTE: With Maraviollantes' permission I have taken over maintaining the book too. This means that the YKYWTMSMW Linux fortunes not found in the book will be integrated into the book and given normal numbering both in the book and in the fortunes. This version (v5.3) will be the last release based on version 5 of the book, with upcoming version 6 of the Linux fortunes to be released along with version 6 of the book. The German YKYWTMSMWs will not be in version 6 of the book.

* v5.1 (2017-05-12) - Updated Makefile to use coreutils install.
