* v6.31-preview3 (2018-09-24)
	* Moved 2978 and 3904 to offensive.
	* Removed 2551 as it is a duplicate of 172.
	* Added "10 Signs You Are Obsessed With 'Sailor Moon'" 2014 article from Buzzfeed. Two are duplicates of, or similar to, existing YKYWTMSMWs, but they are in a different "10 Signs You..." context so they, along with their numbers #1-#10, have been added as N19-N28. N24 is part of the offensive set.
	* Shifted N numbers around in light of above changes.
* v6.31-preview2 (2018-09-23)
	* Add N19-N23.
	* Moved 741, 1841, 1842, 2778, 4672, and 5420 to offensive. 1842 and 5420 I'm on the fence with, but better safe than sorry.
	* Moved 1841 to offensive.
* v6.31-preview1 (2018-09-16)
	* Add N18
* v6.3 (2018-09-03)
	* I've returned to SailorMoonForum.com again. Negative comments removed.
	* SilverMillenniumFalcon is now treated as a second official site for the project, rather than a replacement for SailorMoonForum.
	* SilverMillenniumFalcon links replaced with their Proboards equivalents.
	* Added four more (N14-N17)
* v6.2 (2018-04-03)
	* Removed several spaces in fortunes.
	* Moved 81, 1390, 2870, 3208, 4483, and 6268 to offensive (they were a bit racy)
	* Moved 2168, 2603, and 5421 to offensive.
	* 2154 was mistakenly moved to offensive, put it back in inoffensive
	* Inserted a new N4, and shifted others down.
	* Changed some colons, headings, etc. in the N series.
	* Re-arranged the content in book/others/smtoomuch-future-version.txt so that the need to insert above/below other new entries won't happen as often.
	* Added a bunch of new ones (mostly written by me)
	* There are now 15 additional entries (13+2 off) to v6, found in book/others/smtoomuch-future-version.txt and the fortune files.
	* Instead of promoting sailormoonforum.com, whose new owners and policies have alienated many including myself, this project is now promoting silvermillenniumfalcon.com, a Sailor Moon & Star Wars forum which many of the former "Other SMF" regulars now use instead.
	* As I am not like the owners of The Other SMF, there won't be any edits to existing material (other than documentation) which reference, credit, or promote The Other SMF.
	* So long as I'm allowed to, both SMF and The Other SMF will be monitored for future YKYWTMSMWs, and credit to each site and the users on it will be given as appropriate. 
	* New alias noted.
	* Changed "over 6500" to "over 6600" in README.md
* v6.13 (2018-02-23)

	* Moved 474, 646, 4134, 1876, 5257, and 5414 to offensive.
	* Added thank you to Gunslinger in the README.md
	* Removed unnecessary N4.
	* Added new N4 and N5.
* v6.11 (2017-10-28)
	* Added version 6 errata (book/others/smtoomuch-v6-errata.txt)
	* Added The Annals of YKYWTMSMW Volume II (which was released only as a ZIP compressed TXT file) as book/others/ykywtms2.zip
	* 2819 renamed 2819A, with 2819B and 2819C added (see errata file)
	* Missed duplicate 2484 (see errata file) removed from fortunes (2483 is now followed by 2485)
	* Annals leads changed in fortunes in accordance with errata on headers.
	* Corrected Slackware instructions with regard to viewing offensive smtoomuch fortunes at login.
	* Updates to the source code and/or books prior to official releases will be counted as "-preview(number)" for each calendar date the material has been updated. These revisions to the source are not to be considered actual "versions" - the latest release is still v6.1, the preview number is simply for convenience and testing before the final release, which in this case will be v6.11.
	* Changed N1 a bit for easier integration into the fortunes and next book.
	* Added two more (N3 & N4) to book/others/smtoomuch-future-version.txt

	* Updated the Makefile so as to have separate installation of main fortunes and offensive fortunes
	* Documentation updated with regard to this separate offensive set and what qualifies for an "offensive" fortune.
	* Created book/others/smtoomuch-future-version.txt, containing 2 new YKYWTMSMWs for a future release. They are preceded by the letter N (N1, N2, ...) and have been added to the fortunes as well.
* v6.0 (2017-09-10, Ami Mizuno's Birthday)
	* Version 6 of the book (together with v6.0 of the fortunes) released!
	* Version 6 contains 6596 YKYWTMSMWs (551 YKYWTMSMWs larger than v5)

	* Various updates to README.md
	* Made LICENSE more clear
	* Spun off CHANGES section into its own file.
	* Removed header that was left underneath fortune #2455 by mistake
	* Added additional fortunes (see "others" directory)
	* Fixed possible errors in make uninstall and make clean
	* Updated Slackware note in README with information on showing all non-offensive fortunes.
	* NOTE: With Maraviollantes' permission I have taken over maintaining the book too. This means that the YKYWTMSMW Linux fortunes not found in the book will be integrated into the book and given normal numbering both in the book and in the fortunes. This version (v5.3) will be the last release based on version 5 of the book, with upcoming version 6 of the Linux fortunes to be released along with version 6 of the book. The German YKYWTMSMWs will not be in version 6 of the book.
