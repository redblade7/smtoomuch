-----SOFTWARE BUG REPORTS-----

Please use the Github tracker to report bugs in the software.

-----OFFENSIVE YKYWTMSMWs-----

The "offensive" YKYWTMSMWs have been placed into a separate offensive fortune
set. If there are any offensive fortunes in the main fortune set, please file a report in the Issue Tracker, and if the developer feels the YKYWTMSMW qualifies for the offensive fortune set, it will be moved there. 

Here is a general idea of what qualifies for the offensive fortune set:

	(a) Seven dirty words, four letter words, graphic sexual language
	(b) Sex, nudity, overly racy
	(c) Anything LGBT related
	(d) Crossdressing (including cosplay and Halloween)
	(e) Racism, sexism, homophobia
	(f) Political/religious insults
	(g) Porn and hentai related
	(h) Jokes about incest and bestiality
	(i) "Nostalgia Critic" style remarks

The choices for "offensive" should not be considered a reflection of the developer's personal beliefs, but rather a way to protect the user from the wrong person seeing the wrong YKYWTMSMW at the wrong time. However, as this is an ongoing project, the developer makes no guarantees.

-----CONTRIBUTING TO POSSIBLE ANNUAL/BIANNUAL BOOK UPDATES-----
