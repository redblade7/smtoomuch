YKYWTMSMW Fortunes for Linux

Created by redblade7

--- How to use with xscreensaver ---

You can use the fortunes in conjunction with the Linux xscreensaver package.

To do so, go into the Advanced tab, and under the Text Manipulation section, select "Program" and replace the line with:

fortune -s smtoomuch && echo

The -s option limits the choices to fortunes (number, period, space, YKYWTMSMW) which are less than 160 characters in total.

Since v6.0, adding the "&& echo" to the end is required in order to have blank lines between lines in some of the screensavers.

If you have v6.1 or later and you installed the offensive YKYWTMSMW fortunes, to include them in the screensaver, the line should instead be changed to either of:

(Debian/Ubuntu/Mint users)
fortune -s smtoomuch off/smtoomuch && echo

(Slackware users)
fortune -s smtoomuch smtoomuch-o && echo

The screensavers Apple2, FlipText, FontGlide, NoseGuy, Phosphor, Splitflap, Starwars, and WindupRobot can make use of the fortunes. Included in this folder are screenshots of all but WindupRobot.
