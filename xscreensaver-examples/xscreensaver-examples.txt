YKYWTMSMW Fortunes for Linux

Created by redblade7

--- How to use with xscreensaver ---

You can use the fortunes in conjunction with the Linux xscreensaver package.

To do so, go into the Advanced tab, and under the Text Manipulation section, select "Program" and replace the line with "fortune -s smtoomuch && echo" (no quotes)

The -s option limits the choices to YKYWTMSMWs which are 160 characters or less.

Since version 6, adding the "&& echo" to the end is required in order to have blank lines between lines in some of the screensavers.

The screensavers Apple2, NoseGuy, Phosphor, Splitflap, Starwars, and WindupRobot can make use of the fortunes. Included in this folder are screenshots of all but NoseGuy and WindupRobot.
