YKYWTMSMW Fortunes for Linux v5.0
Created by redblade7, May 11, 2017

These files for the Linux fortune program provide over 6000 "You Know You Watch Too Much Sailor Moon When..." jokes created between c. 1995 and 2007. 

The jokes come from Anton Ptitsin's YKYWTMSMW Compilation book, version 5, released on April 18, 2007. The fortunes are derived from the plaintext version of the book.

Included in the "book" subdirectory is the complete book in DOC, PDF, and plain text.

Enjoy! -redblade7

INSTRUCTIONS:

To install, type:

"make && sudo make install"

Then, type:

"fortune smtoomuch"

to try it out.

NOTES:

(1) All grammar and spelling errors have been left intact.

(2) Some of these jokes fall under subheadings with variations of the YKYWTMSMW formula. They have been represented in fortune as follows: 

"5802.	(When You Know Your Obsessed With Sailor Saturn...) You stay in your house all day and your skin turns pale."

(3) Many of these jokes are in reference to jokes preceding or following it. This is why you may get a fortune along the lines of:

"5149.	You've actually read all of the above."

(4) Sometimes jokes have included attributions, which may not only be applicable to the joke but for previous ones. For example:

"4556.	You cut or style your old Barbie dolls' hair into your favorite senshi's hair styles. (This one and the next submitted by Cleo402@aol.com)"

When you receive #4556 as a fortune, you will not know about #4557 unless you look it up.

(5) Joke #5387 was removed from the fortunes, as it appears to be a subheading mistakenly classified as a joke:

"5387.	You know you're obsessed with Sailor Mercury when- "

Instead, #5388 and #5389 begin with "(You know you're obsessed with Sailor Mercury when...)"

(6) Special and unicode characters were replaced for compatibility with non-unicode terminals. This also required me to cut off the name of the author of #4192-#4195. (You can see the author's name in the book files.)

(7) There are 6044 fortunes in these files which, depending on the amount of fortunes you have installed, might make the likelihood of receiving a YKYWTMSMW fortune higher than you want. If you want to change this behavior, see the fortune man page about the "-e" option.

(8) Slackware will not automatically choose fortunes from these files unless you add "smtoomuch" to the end of the fortune command in /etc/profile.d/bsd-games-login-fortune.sh. You may also want to use "fortune -e" (see note #7). You can also replace the whole line with "fortune -a" if you don't mind seeing Slackware's offensive fortunes too.
